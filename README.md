# crypto-table

Welcome to crypto-table codebase. It's a web app that allows you to find biggest difference of identical trading pairs on different crypto exchanges(only theoretically,
does not work in practice, on all coins or the withdrawal/deposit is blocked, or no volume in order books, or is different chains, so it's a simple pet-project)
